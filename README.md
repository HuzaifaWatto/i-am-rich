# I Am Rich
Date: December 2021
Description:
This is my first project from the iOS 12 App Development course, where I learned the basics of Swift programming and iOS app development. The "I Am Rich" app demonstrates foundational skills such as working with Xcode, designing simple user interfaces, integrating images and text, and it is built using UIKit. The app displays a luxury-themed message, showcasing my early understanding of app layout and design principles.
